# stock_trading
This project simulate stock trading and portfolio by using the following:
- Object-oriented programming
- Database manipulation
- Web scrape
- I/O file
- Data collection and cleaning
- Data analysis and visualization

Stock price data is scraped from websites and imported into database (stock.db)

Test.py contains example code snippet using methods and objects defined in stock.py.

With stock.py, we can import trading orders to portfolio and print out orders' transaction history, portfolio's value, net profit and also visualize the current owned stock's price compared to the market price to assist trading decision.

Disclaimer: all data for orders and trading is completely imaginary. Any similarities to any particular individual's portfolio are just coincidences.
